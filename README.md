Supplementary materials for Turbulence modulation by suspended finite-sized particles - Towards physics-based multiphase subgrid modeling by S. Balachandar, C. Peng, and L.-P. Wang

These supplementary materials include the kernel function (kratio.m) to predict turbulence modulation using flow and particle parameters. The validation data and two MATLAB scripts resulting Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the manuscript "Turbulence modulation by suspended finite-sized particles - Towards physics-based multiphase subgrid modeling by S. Balachandar, C. Peng, and L.-P. Wang" are also included.
